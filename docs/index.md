# Getting started

Welome to Gravity's documentation!

Gravity is a service and configuration manager for everyone. It makes it easy to use other people's settings and services in your application.

We started Gravity because we wanted to define services in plain old PHP libraries without having to adhere to the service and configuration rules of one framework or another.

Suppose:

1. You'd like to use a service defined in a library, and
2. You've installed the library using Composer.

Gravity:

1. Finds the service,
2. Reads its definition,
3. Instantiates it,
4. Returns it to you, and
5. Saves it for the next request.

It's the same for configuration settings.

Gravity makes it easy to create and share services and settings!
