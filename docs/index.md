# Getting started

Gravity is a framework-agnostic service and configuration manager. It makes it easy to use other people's settings and services in your application.

Suppose:

1. You'd like to use a service defined in a library, and
2. You've installed the library using Composer.

Gravity:

1. Finds the service,
2. Reads its definition,
3. Instantiates it,
4. Returns it to you, and
5. Saves it for the next request.

It works the same for configuration settings.

Gravity makes it easy to create and share services and settings.
